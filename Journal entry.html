		  10/16/25: I learned about Cartier divisors today. If X is a Noetherian, integral, locally factorial, separated scheme, then its class group and the Cartier class group are the same. Since X being integral also implies its Cartier class group and Picard group are the same, we have a complete understanding. I also learned about the class group of a projective space, and any divisor of degree \(d\) will come as a multiple of a hyperplane.

			10/17/25: I learned how we define a Cartier divisor if we have an invertible sheaf. We can associate a subscheme, \(Y\) of codimension 1 to an effective Cartier divisor \(D:\{(U_i,f_i)\}\), defined by the sheaf of ideals,\(\mathcal{I}_Y\)  generated locally by \(f_i\)'s. In that case \(\mathcal{I}_Y=\mathcal{L}(-D)\). Also I learned that there are non-singular hypersurfaces of degree \(d\) in \(\mathbb{P}^n\) for large enough \(n\) and for all \(d\geq 1\).</p>

			10/20/25: The kernel bundle is the kernel of the evaluation map which can be obtained by taking the pullback of a twist of the Euler sequence. The kernel bundle for \( \mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^1}(r) \) is \( r \) copies of \( \mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^1}(-1) \).
